<h1>The coolest creature</h1>
<img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/cheetah.png" alt="Cheetahe">
<p>The <em>Cheetah</em> is awesome because <strong>Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds of up to 120 km/h. Their flexible spine allows them to cover an impressive 7 meters in a single stride. With non-retractable claws for better grip during sprints, they are perfectly built for speed. Tear-like facial markings help reduce glare and improve focus on prey, and their unique spot patterns make each cheetah as distinctive as a fingerprint.
